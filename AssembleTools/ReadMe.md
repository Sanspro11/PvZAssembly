None of these programs are mine (except for the 'compile.bat' but thats just 2 commands for convenience), Im simply uploading it here in order for other people to compile the game.asm file easily.

In order to compile it, put all of these files in the same directory as game.asm, and run "compile game" in order to compile game.asm into an exe (all of this has to be done in the DOS emulator).
