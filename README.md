This is the Plants vs Zombes but its the "scuffed version"
Its for the grade 10 Assembly project in the Gvahim (גבהים) program.

Originally i wanted to do a game similar to Plants vs Zombies, but as i developed this game, I kind of made my own game with its own rules (which is probably a game that already exists in other variants)
This entire project is in Assembly, no other languages.
I put the files needed to assemble the game.asm file if you want to compile it and see it for yourself.
You HAVE to run this game in a DOS emulator, you cant run it on windows/linux/mac/any other modern os.
Have fun playing!
